## The challenge

The challenge is to build out BLOCKCHAIN UNN - NFT preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.



## Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.  both a mobile and a desktop version of the design can be found in the design folder. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPG and my  best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`, `border`, `border-radius`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.



## Building My project

I used a workflow that i feel comfortable with.

 Below is the  process followed in carried out this project:

1.I Initialized my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and also Created a repo that  make it easier to share my code with the community for contribution should the needs arises. 
2.  my repository was Configured to publish my code to a web address. 
3.  the designs was used as a guildlines in planning out  this project. This step was  helpful to me in thinking ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles,my content was well  structured with HTML. Writing my HTML first  help me focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
5. the base styles for my project were clearly written out, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. I Started adding styles from the top of the page and work down and Only moved on to the next section once  i've completed the area i was working on.
